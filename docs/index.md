A free and open-source wiki for learning Ido!

## What is Ido?
**Ido** is a constructed language designed with the goal of being a
**universal second language** (also known as an
[international auxiliary language]) for people of different linguistic
backgrounds.

To function as an effective international auxiliary language, Ido was
specifically designed to be [grammatically], [orthographically], and
[lexicographically regular] (and, above all, easy to learn and use).
